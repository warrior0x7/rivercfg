   <media:description>On this podcast, Jay and Joao have discussed multiple times a situation where a threat actor submits a pull request that's more than the project bargained for. And now, we have a situation where OpenSSH was (almost) backdoored by a commit by a maintainer of the xz project. Don't miss this episode for all the details!
